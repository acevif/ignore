# AI Agent Instructions for `ignore`

This file contains project-specific instructions for AI coding agents (Codex, Gemini, etc.) when working on this repository.

## Development

When developing:

* Follow Twada-style TDD: start with a failing test, implement the minimum to pass, then refactor.

## Autonomy and Communication

* You can proceed autonomously for routine decisions, but ask before any risky operation or important decision.
* Balance communication: too much back-and-forth communication slows progress, too little risks misalignment. Favor moderate autonomy and check in when it materially affects outcomes.
